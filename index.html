                <h2>Mission</h2>
                <p>I've spent my life riding and building trails—two passions that shaped everything I know about mountain biking. At Polku, I bring that experience to riders looking to improve and landowners ready to build. It's not just a business; it's what I love to do.</p>

                <h2>Coaching</h2>
                <p>You don't need to ride at a high level to ride safely. We're lucky to live in Bellingham, Washington—home to some of the world's best trails, from mellow rides to serious challenges. At Polku, we focus on bike awareness and control, helping riders build fundamental skills and expand their comfort zone. Whether you're just getting started or looking to level up, we're here to help.</p>

                <h2>Trail Building</h2>
                <p>Mountain biking thrives on great trails—and who doesn't want their own? From hiking paths to machine-built jump lines, Polku works with individuals and organizations to build trails that exceed expectations. We bring years of machine experience and a lifetime of hand-building expertise. Whether it's a hiking trail on your property or a pump track in your backyard, we'd love to help make it happen.</p>
